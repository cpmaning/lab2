            <h2>SOCIT Week</h2>
            <br>
        <ul class="paragraph2">
        This year s SOCIT fest was kind of  a downer since there s not much activity to do. It s just a <br>
        bunch of seminars, but quite educational, so I guess its ok. The speakers in the seminars shared their <br>
        experiences on how they started from the bottom until to what they are right now. Since some of the <br>
        speakers are the CEO s of their own company. You can really see that the job they do is really their <br>
        passion, you can see in the way they speak the energy and how excited they are to share their <br>
        experiences in life and explaining to us about the gaming industry here in the Philippines. It really <br>
        surprised me on how old the gaming industry here in the Philippines. They said that it s already 15 years <br>
        old here, I thought that the industry was at least 10 years old or something. That kind of made me feel old. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I still hoped that the SOCIT fest would have more activities for the students to do, like more <br>
        tournaments like DOTA 2 or LOL. Since the tournaments that week was only just mobile legends and <br>
        Tekken. We couldve joined the mobile legends tournament, but we have a quiz bee on our subject <br>
        making us unable to join. Overall it was an ok fest, so Im hoping for a better fest next year.<br>
