            <h2>Favorite Applications</h2>
        <ul class="paragraph1">
        <h3>Messenger</h3><br>
        <br>
        One of my favorite applications is messenger, because this is a very useful app. It helps me to<br>
        communicate with other people. It has a feature where you can create a group chat, which enables<br>
        a better communication between the group. You can also send pictures, document files, and videos.<br>
        With that it can help me express my feelings better through sending of memes/pictures. I also<br> 
        put some of my school work files in here, especially the codes, research papers and assignments<br>
        in here. The app also has a videocall feature which helps me feel like I'm just close to the <br>
        person/people talking to. You can also send a message for free because of free data though this<br>
        limits its feature. That last feature is pretty useful for me because I don’t usually buy load <br>
        for my internet use, thats why this is a very helpful app for me. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Facebook</h3><br>
        Things that I liked in this application is that I can be updated to the news for whatever is <br>
        happening to the world or to my friends or relatives. It helped me learned a lot about people’s<br>
        likes and dislikes, though there are a lot of fake news, it makes you really want to research<br>
        thoroughly every post you see. I use this app to pass time by scrolling the news feed searching <br>
        for memes and sharing it with other people. It helps me express my feelings creatively and is my leisure app.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Steam</h3><br>
        I like this application because this serves as a platform for games, messaging, trading, and buying items<br>
        which is all game related. Steam has also a lot of games to offer. It also lets you interact with <br>
        strangers you meet on the games in steam, which gives you a perspective on what are the characteristics<br>
        of other players in the world. If steam helps me interact with strangers, it lets me interact better<br>
        with my friends whenever we play a game. It also has a steam guard which secures your account.<br>
