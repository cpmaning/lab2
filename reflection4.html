        This has been very challenging for me and my groupmates since there has been a lot of problems<br>
        that we can think of, but it does need a technological solution yet that is feasible to do<br>
        for us, there are also problems that can be solve without a need for creating an app. Our first<br>
        title was really good since we get to take advantage of the e-wallet here at APC and it can solve<br>
        a problem we personally have experienced with. Not only it can solve a problem here in APC, but we<br>
        can also contribute something to the organization. Though we have the same kind of project with other<br>
        groups, so we needed to change the project, and it was really frustrating for us. We have already<br>
        started some designs for the interface of the project, but we needed to change it. So, a groupmate<br>
        has thought of another project and we used the same designs from our first project and changed it<br>
        a little, since this new project is a different type of app that the first app. Overall itâ€™s a<br>
        learning experience for me and my groupmates, that there are really a lot of things to consider<br>
        in creating an application/website.<br>
