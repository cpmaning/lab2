            <br>
        <ul class="paragraph1">
            These past few weeks of attending this class has been quite refreshing and interesting. Since interaction<br>
            with everyone is encouraged, like how Ms. Jen lets us experiment with the sites that she introduced<br>
            to us, and those sites is more likely to be interactive. Like in Trello, she lets us have fun experimenting<br>
            with its feature. I also like the activities that was given to us, since we get to share our ideas<br>
            and likes. Since class that encourage to open to everyone to share ideas and has been open to everyone, the<br>
            environment is light and fun, which makes us to learn in a fun way.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I’ve learned a few sites and mobile sites that can really be helpful because of the interaction between<br> 
            me and my classmates. An example of that is the YouTube Vanced, which is a mobile app that lets the user<br>
            still play the video even though the user is using other applications. This is piqued my interest since I <br> 
            don’t like Spotify because of the shuffle play and I don’t want to pay for the subscription, when there is YouTube.<br> 
            Although paying for it is like a support for the artist, I’m sure that they are earning a lot because there are a lot<br>
            of people supporting them. I also like the energy of my professor since it helps me not to be sleepy in class. I<br>
            like how she makes examples that can be easily understood by everyone.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m hoping to be able to show my creativeness in creating an app or designing it in the future activities.<br>
