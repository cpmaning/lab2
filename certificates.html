            <h4>Powerpoint 2016 Microsoft Office Specialist</h4>
        <ul class="paragraph2">
        I finished this course back then on my first year in college. It was an interesting course<br>
        since I thought I already knew a lot about powerpoint presentation, but there are new things.<br>
        that I ve learned, like some of its hidden features.<br>

        </ul>
        <h4>Learning SQL Programming</h4><br>
        <ul class="paragraph2">
        This course was really helpful for me because I had a hard time understanding SQL.<br>
        Really need some catching for my DATAMA class and like I ve said this really helped me. <br>

        </ul>
        <h4>Database Foundations</h4><br>
        <ul class="paragraph2">
        This course helped my understand atleast some basic things I need to know about<br>
        database. Would suggest this course for others who have a hard time understanding<br>
        database in general.<br>
