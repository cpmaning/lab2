            <h2>Third Week (USERDES)</h2>
            <br>
        <ul class="paragraph2">
        For the third week of our class, we have discussed about making solutions to some problems<br>
        we encounter to our daily life. For example, in the video Ms. Jen showed us about the guys that<br>
        spent time in the grocery because they wanted to solve the problem in the grocery which has a problem.<br>
        They spent time there to find a way to solve that particular problem. I realize that designing a<br>
        solution takes a lot of research, spending time to the place that needs solution by observing, gathering<br>
        data and many more. There has been a lot of links that has been given to us to help us with designing<br>
        for an application, software, webpage, etc. Every link was very helpful, especially to the laboratory<br>
        activity that was given to us, which is to create our own webpage. Creating our own webpage is quite<br>
        fun since we get to design our personal webpage which is about us.<br>
        <br>
        <br> 
        We can put whatever we like or please in there. It also helps us develop our creativity better. The<br>
        links can be quite overwhelming though because it is too many and I donâ€™t know where to start. <br>
        Anyways its a fun and creative week for me.<br>
