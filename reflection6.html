        The whole midterms of attending USERDES class is a rollercoaster for me, since there has been a lot of <br>
        things going. From the first day knowing nothing or is lost about what is really designing. Now the <br>
        subject gave me insight to what is needed to design, how to design and to be able to share design ideas <br>
        with my classmates. The first lab activity that was given to us was quite tough, since I know that Iâ€™m not <br>
        really good at coding and has little idea how to design and create my own website. Now, as attending <br>
        the class since the end of midterms, I have learned a lot of things about designing, what tools to use and <br>
        website links that is helpful for us to be able to interact with others and websites that let us store our <br>
        projects. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        My expectations for the finals is that it might be a bit challenging than the midterms since finals are <br>
        supposed to be harder or the last is supposed to be harder than the first.<br>
