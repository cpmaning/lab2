                Hi, my name is Christian Maning!<br>
                You can call me by my surname. <br>
                I am 19 years old. I currently live with my mother at Evangelista in Makati.<br>
                <br>
                As for my story, I really don t have  something unusual or unique experiences currently.
                All seems to be pretty normal. I manage most of time in leisure like playing games and 
                surfing the net.Watching new educational stuff. I also spend time with my parents and 
                friends as equally as much as possible, depends on the time I have. People often see me 
                as a quiet type of person but once they get to know me I get to be more open and hyperactive.
                I usually have different attitudes depends on who I m with. I m more respectful when I m 
                with the company of adults, strangers or authorities.I m usually lazy but can be hardworking
                when needed.<br>
                <br>
