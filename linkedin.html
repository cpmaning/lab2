        <ul class="paragraph2">
        This course in LinkedIn helped me get an idea about designing my own web.<br>
        LinkedIn has a lot of good courses like this one in their website.<br>
        This really helped me creating my own website.<br>

        <h4>UX Design: Overview</h4><br>
        <ul class="paragraph2">
        This short course showed the overview in designing an application or website.<br>
        There are really a lot of things to consider in UX designing, its one of the <br>
        things needed in formulating a solution for the users.<br>

        </ul>
        <h4>UX Design for Developers</h4><br>
        <ul class="paragraph2">
        Just like the previous course about UX-design, it started pointing out a lot of things to<br>
        consider in designing something. Though if I m being honest, I really didnt finish this<br>
        course due to the lack of time and tightness of schedule. But, upon reading the overview<br>
        I think that it would really be worthwhile in watching this course. I would definitely<br>
        go back and finish this course in my free time.<br>
