        <h3>GROUP 1 - S.C.M.K</h3><br>
        <h3>PLAN = "Disaster/Donation Application"</h3><br>
        <br>
        <h3>Problem</h3><br>
        As you all know, the Philippines is located in the ring of fire which makes it prone to many <br>
        natural disasters. Such as typhoons, earthquakes, landslides, floods, volcanic eruptions, and many<br>
        more. Due to many disasters found around the Philippines, donations are constantly requested. However,<br>
        with the increase of donations comes with an increase of fraud. One of the which is the Mar Roxas "misused"<br>
        fund scandal during the Yolanda disaster. Another personal experience from one of the members is that <br>
        whenever he is required to donate for the poor, the management staff just kept the goods in the storeroom<br>
        instead of giving it to the needy. He thought of that conclusion due to the lack of update unto<br>
        what happened to the goods<br>
        <br>
        --Lack of organization (very messy whenever a disaster hits)<br>
        --Lack of coordination (things go south when things don't go well)<br>
        --Lack of information (where to donate, different disasters around the country)<br>
        --Confusion (everyone gets distracted which makes it hard to work towards the common goal)<br>
        --Lack of security when donating(no certification, credible locations)<br>
        --A lot of possible scams(donations received but never delivered)<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Solutions</h3><br>
        The possible solution that the group discussed is that we would create a platform that could be<br>
        trustworthy and more friendly. Our group decided to make an application that could possibly help<br>
        prevent and make it easier for the donators to donate.<br>
        <br>
        --An application that tells you the nearest location when donating<br>
        --Notifies the users to the news about natural disasters that is happening around us<br>
        --Coordination<br>
        --More trustworthy platform for donation<br>
        --Certified donation locations<br>
        --Can alert users whenever a donation is needed<br>
