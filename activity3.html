            <h2>1000 Floor Building Elevator Design</h2>
        <ul class="paragraph2">
        Designing an interface for an elevator for a one thousand floor building is quite tough<br>
        since there are a lot of variables to be considered. Since this is a thousand floor building, it<br>
        is to be expected to be a super building. There is a huge chance that this building can be <br>
        considered a city. Where it has a residential area and commercial areas. The elevator will be<br>
        considered as the mode of transportation inside the building. <br>
        <br>
        So, my design for the interface of the elevator is that it will be like a calculator where the user/s<br>
        can add one floor, five floors, ten floors, twenty, fifty and a hundred floors. The interface will<br>
        also have a clear button, so they can clear the digit they wanted to erase. Even though with this<br>
        interface it is still hard and can have a lot of problems. One of the problems is that even with a<br>
        calculator interface, adding one floor to a thousand can be quite problematic. Specially if it’s<br>
        rush hour, trying to input the floor you wanted can still be a hassle. Another problem is that<br>
        having an elevator go to one floor to one thousand can take some time.<br>
        <br>
        To solve that problem, I ve researched about some designs to help me solve this problem and I’ve <br>
        come up with a solution. Let’s say that this building has a residence area and every fiftieth<br>
        floor is the residence area. Every elevator will have to stop every fiftieth floor, to make it<br>
        convenient and faster. There will be another set of elevators on the floor fifty-one up to a <br>
        hundred floor. A calculator interface will also be implemented here since fifty is still a huge<br>
        number but quite reasonable for a calculator interface. Here’s the visual representation of the <br>
        interface I ve been thinking.<br>
        <br>
        <div class="pic1">
                <img src="elevator-button.png" height="300px" width="400px"><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        It is designed to be like a calculator, but it will only take input up to two digits and specifically<br>
        up to fifty only. Since the elevators will stop at every fiftieth floor. The buttons are designed to<br>
        have a carving for the blind user/s, for them to be able to use the elevator. At the right part of<br>
        the interface is the display of the floors that has been input. The interface also has an<br>
        emergency button to click, which can be seen at the top left corner, which can be used<br>
        whenever there is an emergency. At the top left corner there will be a speaker, which will tell<br>
        the people what floor they are right now, just like in the trains whenever they reached a station<br>
        a speaker will tell them the station they are right now. This will be helpful for the blind people.<br>
        <br>
        Another design of the system is that whenever a person/people comes in before it goes up or down.<br> 
        The user will need to input a floor before the elevator starts to move. The elevator can tell<br>
        whether someone got in because of the addition of weight.<br>
        <br>
        I m sure that since it’s a very tall and large building, not everyone will explore the floors. So <br>
        this would be my interface for the elevator for a thousand floor building.<br>
